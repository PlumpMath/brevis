## Prerequisites:

The prerequisites are an IDE, the Clojure libraries and development environment, the git version control system, and the brevis source code.

Software you will need (all work for Linux, OS X, and Windows):

Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/ (I generally download Eclipse Classic)

Counterclockwise Eclipse plugin - http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/wiki/Documentation#Install_Counterclockwise_plugin
[In Eclipse: Help menu->Install new software->Update site : http://ccw.cgrand.net/updatesite/]

Git version control can be performed within Eclipse (http://eclipse.github.com/); however, I use stand-alone git programs (see the "Applications" section at the bottom of https://github.com/).

## Usage

Developed for use with the Clojure Eclipse plugin, CounterClockwise (this must be installed).

0. Obtain brevis from http://github.com/kephale/brevis

1. Create a default project in Eclipse. 

Uncheck the default location and point it to the location to which brevis was obtained.

2. Right click on the new project Leiningen->Reset Project Configuration

3. Open brevis.example.swarm

4. Menu: Clojure -> Load file in REPL

Keyboard keys:

esc - kill the simulation

...

5. Try doing things in your repl like: (reset! avoidance 0.2)

6. Enjoy. There is more to come...
